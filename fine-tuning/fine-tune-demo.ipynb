Within a week, the charger started to overheat, and the flimsy build quality became evident. The USB ports feel loose, and my cables frequently disconnect. This product is not reliable and certainly not worth the price. I expected much better performance and durability. Save your money and invest in a more reputable charger.\n",

To make matters worse, the Bluetooth connection frequently drops, making them nearly unusable for any extended listening session.

To top it off, the chair started squeaking loudly within a few days of use. For the high price, I expected much better quality and durability. Save yourself the trouble and choose a different office chair.\n",
